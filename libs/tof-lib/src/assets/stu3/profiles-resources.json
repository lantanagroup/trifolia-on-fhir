MPIs are highly specialized applications, often tailored extensively to the institution\\'s particular mix of patients. MPIs can also be run on a regional and national basis.\\n\\nTo ask an MPI to match a patient, clients use the \\\"$match\\\" operation, which accepts a patient resource which may be only partially complete.

The generic $match operation does not specify any particular algorithm, nor a minimum set of information that must be provided when asking for an MPI match operation to be performed, but may implementations will have a set of minimum information, which may be declared in their definition of the $match operation by specifying a profile on the resource parameter, indicating which properties are required in the search.\\n\\nThe patient resource coming into the operation does not have to be complete, nor does it need to pass validation (i.e. Mandatory fields don\\'t need to be populated), but it does have to be a valid instance.
